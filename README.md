# MM3110-CMEL

This repository contains the MATLAB source codes for the assignments of MM3110 Computational Materials Engineering Lab course taken at IIT Madras during Jul-Nov 2021.

## Contents 
- Fundamentals of Data Analysis

    This assignment is based on Monte Carlo simulations. The idea behind using Monte Carlo simulations to compute probabilities is explained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00851), which is written by one of the course instructors. 

- Linear & Non-Linear Equations

    Numerical methods such as Newton-Raphson method and secant method are used to solve linear and non-linear equations.
